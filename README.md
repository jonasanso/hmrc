# HMRC pre interview assignment

Run the test using
```
sbt test

## Notes

* Start review with Checkout object.
* There is no Main class.
* I used pennies as the price unit to avoid the need of using float, double or big decimal.
* I did basic unit testing with specs2
* I spent around 50 minutes, although I was interrupted a few times by recruiters.
* Corner cases in input are not handled
